# Installing as a binary
- Download prometheus here [Prometheus Download Page](https://prometheus.io/download/#prometheus)
- Extract
```
tar xvfz prometheus-*.tar.gz
```
- Create two new directories for Prometheus to use. The /etc/prometheus directory stores the Prometheus configuration files. The /var/lib/prometheus directory holds application data.
```
sudo mkdir /etc/prometheus /var/lib/prometheus
```
- Move to extracted directory
```
cd prometheus*
```

```
sudo mv prometheus promtool /usr/local/bin/
sudo mv prometheus.yml /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
sudo mv consoles/ console_libraries/ /etc/prometheus/
```
- Configure prometheus to run as a service
```
sudo useradd -rs /bin/false prometheus
sudo chown -R prometheus: /etc/prometheus /var/lib/prometheus
```
- Create a service file
```
sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/prometheus.service
```
- Write below data to service file
```

# Prometheus Configuration File Location
Prometheus YML file is located at following `/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml`
Here is what a default configuration file will look like.

```
# my global config
global:
  scrape_interval:     15s # Set the scrape interval to every 15 seconds. Default is every 1 minute.
  evaluation_interval: 15s # Evaluate rules every 15 seconds. The default is every 1 minute.
  # scrape_timeout is set to the global default (10s).

  # Attach these labels to any time series or alerts when communicating with
  # external systems (federation, remote storage, Alertmanager).
  external_labels:
      monitor: 'codelab-monitor'

# Load rules once and periodically evaluate them according to the global 'evaluation_interval'.
rule_files:
  # - "first.rules"
  # - "second.rules"

# A scrape configuration containing exactly one endpoint to scrape:
# Here it's Prometheus itself.
scrape_configs:
  # The job name is added as a label `job=<job_name>` to any timeseries scraped from this config.
  - job_name: 'prometheus'

    # metrics_path defaults to '/metrics'
    # scheme defaults to 'http'.

    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9090',"44.210.237.232:9100"]
```

# Access Prometheus
You can now login to `http://IP_Address:9090` to access Prometheus GUI.
If you can't access the page it can be either because prometheus service is not started or port is not allowed from outside world.

# Commands to open firewall ports on centos 7
- Check ports which are allowed
```
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-ports
```
- Allow 9090 port
```
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=9090/tcp --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```
